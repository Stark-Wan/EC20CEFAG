TEST NAME: pctest

USAGE:
1. pctest suspend  <DELAY> <WAKEUP TIMER> <TIMEOUT> [OPTIONS]
2. pctest idle-pc  <DELAY1> <TIMEOUT1>
3. pctest idle-pc  <DELAY1> <TIMEOUT1> <TIMER1>

DESCRIPTION:
Tests the target for suspend power-collapse(1) or idle power collapse(2). Suspend power 
collapse is user-triggered power collapse mechanism supported by the linux kernel. Idle
power collapse is triggered when the linux kernel goes idle. Pctest is supported for all
targets.

INPUTS:

DELAY:        delay in seconds after which the suspend power collapse is started.
WAKEUP_TIMER: timer in seconds after which the target is woken up from suspend 
              power collapse
TIMEOUT:      timeout in seconds after which the suspend power collapse test bails out. 
OPTIONS can be:
              -tcxo:  do not test tcxo shutdown 
DELAY1:       delay in seconds after which the idle-pc test is started
TIMEOUT1:     duration of sleep for the idle-pc test.
TIMER1:       periodicity of timer, to stress the idle-pc path.

TARGETS SUPPORTED:


The test is supported on all the targets including:
8660 SURF / FFA
7x30 SURF / FFA / FLUID
8650 SURF / FFA
7627 SURF / FFA
