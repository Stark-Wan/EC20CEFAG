DESCRIPTION: The `libffi\' library provides a portable, high level programming interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to call any function specified by a call interface description at run time. FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code written in one language to call code written in another language.  The `libffi\' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must exist above `libffi\' that handles type conversions for values passed between the two languages.
