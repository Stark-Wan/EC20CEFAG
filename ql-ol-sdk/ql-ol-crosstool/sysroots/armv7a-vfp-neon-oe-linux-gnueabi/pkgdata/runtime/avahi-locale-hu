DESCRIPTION_avahi-locale-hu: Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery. It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts running on a local network with no specific configuration. This tool implements IPv4LL, "Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses" (IETF RFC3927), a protocol for automatic IP address configuration from the link-local 169.254.0.0/16 range without the need for a central server.  This package contains language translation files for the hu locale.
